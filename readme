## Real-Time Facial and Hand Landmark Detection

#### Objective:
The goal of this project is to detect and visualize facial and hand landmarks in real-time using a webcam feed. This technology has applications in augmented reality, gesture recognition, and human-computer interaction.

#### Methodology:

MediaPipe Holistic Model: Utilizes MediaPipe's holistic model, which is capable of detecting facial and hand landmarks simultaneously. The model is initialized with a minimum detection and tracking confidence of 0.5.

Video Capture: Uses the computer's default camera to capture live video frames. The video frames are resized for better viewing and processing efficiency.

#### Image Processing:

Converts the camera's BGR image format to RGB to suit the model's requirements.
Processes the converted image using the holistic model to detect landmarks.
Converts the image back to BGR format for display purposes.


#### Landmark Drawing:

Utilizes MediaPipe's drawing utilities to overlay detected facial contours and hand landmarks onto the live video feed.
Facial landmarks are highlighted with specific contours and colors for clarity.
Both hands' landmarks are also drawn, showing connections between landmarks to represent the hand structure.
Performance Measurement:

Calculates and displays frames per second (FPS) on the video feed to monitor the system's performance in real-time.

#### Interactive Control:

Allows the user to terminate the video feed and close the application by pressing the 'q' key.
Technologies Used:

#### Python programming language.
OpenCV for handling video capture and image operations.
MediaPipe for holistic landmark detection and drawing utilities.

#### Outcome:
The system provides a robust platform for detecting and visualizing facial and hand landmarks in real-time. This setup can be extended or integrated into more complex systems for various applications, including motion analysis, interactive gaming, and virtual reality environments.
